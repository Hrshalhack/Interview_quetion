The SQL SELECT Statement->
The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database.

The data returned is stored in a result table, called the result-set.

SELECT Syntax->

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;

Here, column1, column2, ... are the field names of the table you want to 
select data from. If you want to select all the fields available in the table,
use the following syntax:

SELECT * FROM table_name;

#example-> given table(customer), columns(customerName,City,Cid)

1)SELECT CustomerName, City FROM Customers; (we select two columns here)

2)SELECT * FROM Customers; (if we want to print all columns of table,we use *)

3) ORDER BY city ASC; (it print city column values in ascending order)

(note-> to understand where,see w3schools (SQL Where))
4) The SQL WHERE -> The WHERE clause is used to filter records.

  It is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition.

WHERE Syntax->

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

#example->The following SQL statement selects all the customers from the
          country "Mexico", in the "Customers" table:

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Mexico';

#example-> 

SELECT student_name
FROM student
WHERE student_id NOT IN (4,7)    //4 or 7 id ko chod dega, baki sb select krega
ORDER BY student_name asc;

#example-> 

SELECT department_name
FROM department
WHERE department_block_number = 3  //it display only department no.3
ORDER BY department_name asc;

#example-> 

SELECT student_name
FROM student
WHERE SUBSTRING(student_name, 3, 1) = ‘a’ //it show students names that strats with 'a'
ORDER BY student_name ASC;
