4 properties->

1) Atomicity -> transaction ke time agr data pr operation krte time agr koi 
                transacion fail ho jata he to hm transaction ko roll back
                krenge mtlb ek bhi operation execute nhi honga.

2)Consistency -> before transaction start and after the transaction end
                 the sum of money of both accounts should be same.

3) isolation -> multiple transactions happen independently , without 
                interfaring with anyone. one transaction is hide for 
                another transaction.

4) Durablity ->  once the transaction done , the changes stay there always
                if system fails. (backup of data)
