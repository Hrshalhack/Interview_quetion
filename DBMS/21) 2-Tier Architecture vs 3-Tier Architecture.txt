2-Tier Architecture -> it is less secure.because user can also access the info
  of hole db.(ex.we have gov website and we access our familily info. but we also
  access the others family info,so its less secure)
3-Tier Architecture-> there is application server for db. it is more secure.
(ex. the application server verify that you only access your family info not
 others family info)

   2 tier is faster as compared to 3 tier.
